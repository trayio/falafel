# Falafel

A Node.js framework for making it crazy easy to build connectors. Built on top of the
[threadneedle](https://github.com/trayio/threadneedle) allowing for a declarative operation based approach.

Falafel uses JavaScript-based schemas as a superset of connectors.json, but unlike connectors.json, the schema also has a direct impact on the running of operations.
For example, the use of `required` makes a field required in connectors.json as well
as on the operational level.


## Usage

[View the documentation](https://trayio.github.io/falafel/) for usage information.
